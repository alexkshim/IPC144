1) When passing an array to a function is it "by address" or "by value" - explain.

-It is passing by address because the user will pass the pointer to the array when it passing the function.

(passing the fisrt element then it will automatically pass others (I mean, all of the things inside the array) when using passing an array to function by reference).





2) Explain why functions with an array parameter are usually complemented with an additional integer parameter (reference specifics in this workshop to explain your answer).

-Because the another integer parameter will be used for the index of the array parameter.

there is one example in this workshop,

void displayInventory(const struct Book book[], const int size)

As shown above, the constant structure Book book[] is using size as its index to change its index for size times.






3) Why do some of the functions in this workshop specify "const" for the array parameters and not in others?

-if passing one variable(argument) to another(parameter), it sometimes change the value unless it is passing address with const values.

Constant -> If the user doesn't want what is inside to be modified
