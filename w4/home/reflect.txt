1)	Why do the arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements?

In case the input is more than 4, it has to be so. If the user enters 10, this requires those 10 number of elements.

2)	What are the advantages and disadvantages of using matching arrays?

The advantage is it can vary because you initialize the indexs inside the arrays. However, the disadvatage is it can be more complicated and take more lines.

3)	Was the at home portion of this workshop too easy, just right or too hard? Why? 

This was extremely harder than other previous workshops including the in lab portion of this workshop
because this requires making complicated loops at the bottom of the code.
